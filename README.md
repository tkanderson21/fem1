## My process

First and foremost, I worked on the HTML. I added two 'wrappers' wrapping the content together. The first being around the container containing the text and the QR code, the second being around the content and the footer; however, this was more utilized when creating the responsive mobile-version. 

I worked on the desktop version first and then moved onto the mobile version. Unfortunately, as I need much, and I mean **much** more practice with making my websites responsive, I only really changed the look for the 400px resolution. I'll try to do much more research into responsive web design as I think I struggle with it a lot.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I want to continue to work on responsive web design because I feel like I'm not totally comfortable with it yet.  Other than that, I can't think of anything off the top of my head that I would like to directly improve on yet, aside from maybe learning how to refactor better. But other than that, I'm pretty happy with what I did!
