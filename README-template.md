## My process

First and foremost, I worked on the HTML. I added two 'wrappers' wrapping the content together. The first being around the container containing the text and the QR code, the second being around the content and the footer; however, this was more utilized when creating the responsive mobile-version. 

I worked on the desktop version first and then moved onto the mobile version. Unfortunately, as I need much, and I mean **much** more practice with making my websites responsive, I only really changed the look for the 400px resolution. I'll try to do much more research into responsive web design as I think I struggle with it a lot.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned



Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to continue to work on responsive web design because I feel like I'm not totally comfortable with it yet.  Other than that, I can't think of anything off the top of my head that I would like to directly improve on yet, aside from maybe learning how to refactor better. But other than that, I'm pretty happy with what I did!
